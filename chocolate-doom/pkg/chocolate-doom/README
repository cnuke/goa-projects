Chocolate-doom is a Doom1/2 engine source port that tries to
stay true to the original DOS versions.

This pkg is configured for playing the Doom 1 shareware version. It can
also be used to play the Heretic 1 shareware as well as the Hexen 1 demo
by changing the 'init.config' file. Replace all occurences of 'doom' to
either 'heretic' or 'hexen' (the Hexen 1 demo file has to be called
'hexen.wad', there is no '1' in the name).

The pkg requires Nic and Gui services, Audio_out is optional.
